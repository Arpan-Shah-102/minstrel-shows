                                The Gilded Age (1870s-1900) was marked by rapid economic growth, industrialization, and the rise of big business, but also by inequality and corruption.

                            <li>
                                European empires expanded their colonial empires globally, leading to increased trade and cultural exchange, but also to conflicts and tensions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The Spanish-American War (1898) resulted in the US gaining control of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, marking America's emergence as a global power.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Millions of immigrants came to the US from Europe seeking better opportunities. They contributed to cultural diversity but faced discrimination.

                            <li>

                    <h4>Daniel Decatur Emmett</h4>
                    <div class="left-bar">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                An American songwriter and entertainer, best known for composing "Dixie," a song that became an anthem of the Confederacy during the Civil War.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Emmett was a key figure in the development of minstrel shows; a popular form of entertainment in the 19th century that featured white performers in blackface portraying caricatured representations of African Americans.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                His work contributed to the perpetuation of racial stereotypes, and his legacy is controversial due to the racist nature of minstrel shows.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Thomas "Daddy" Rice</h4>
                    <div class="left-bar">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                An American performer and playwright, often credited as the "father of American minstrelsy." He is best known for creating the character "Jim Crow," which he portrayed in blackface.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Rice's performances were hugely popular in the early 19th century and played a significant role in popularizing minstrel shows across the United States.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Like Emmett, Rice's legacy is controversial due to the racist nature of his performances and their impact on perpetuating harmful stereotypes about African Americans.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Frank Dumont</h4>
                    <div class="left-bar">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                An American minstrel performer, playwright, and theater manager. He was known for his work in the minstrel show tradition and for writing several popular minstrel songs.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Dumont was also involved in managing theaters and producing minstrel shows, contributing to the popularity of this form of entertainment in the late 19th century.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                His work, like that of other minstrel performers, is viewed critically today due to its role in promoting racial stereotypes.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h4>E.P. Christy</h4>
                    <div class="left-bar">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                An American entertainer and minstrel show performer, best known for founding Christy's Minstrels, one of the most famous minstrel troupes of the 19th century.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Christy's Minstrels were known for their elaborate performances, which included music, dance, and comedy sketches, often featuring white performers in blackface.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Christy's contributions to the minstrel show tradition helped shape American popular entertainment during the 19th century, but his legacy is also marked by the racist stereotypes perpetuated by these performances.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Stephen Foster</h4>
                    <div class="left-bar">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                An American composer best known for writing popular songs performed in minstrel shows, including "Oh! Susanna" and "Camptown Races."
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Foster's melodies were catchy and widely performed, making him one of the most influential songwriters of the 19th century minstrel tradition.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                His legacy is complex, as his songs, while musically significant, often perpetuated racial stereotypes common in minstrel entertainment of his time.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
